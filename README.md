# LaPOLeaF
A semisupervised classification method with Label Propagation in Optimal Leading Forest

Existing graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) treats all data points as in peer-to-peer relation. Consequently, it requires iterative optimization to achieve a preset objective, which usually leads to high computing cost. Another inconvenience of GSSL is that the learning procedure has to be conducted from scratch when predicting out-of-sample data. By leveraging the partial order relation induced by the local density and distance between the data, we develop a highly efficient non-iterative label propagation algorithm based on a novel data structure named as optimal leading forest (LaPOLeaF). LaPOLeaF efficiently fulfils the label propagation procedure and delivers the label for a new datum, both in $O(n)$ time complexity. Hence, the major two weaknesses of the traditional GSSL are addressed. In addition, the leading forest constructed offers good interpretability to the learning result. We further scale the proposed method to accommodate big data by utilizing block distance matrix technique and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Extensive experiments completed on datasets of different nature have shown the superior efficiency and very competitive accuracy of the proposed method.
